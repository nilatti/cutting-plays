          <em>Hamlet.</em> Act Two, Scene Two. A group of travelling players
          have arrived at Elsinore. Our inspired title character exhorts his
          guests to reprise one of their past performances: an epic depiction of
          the fall of Troy. One player steps up with relish, and performs the
          evocative scene with details, images, and free-flowing descriptors.
          Sixty lines into the speech, Hamlet remains enthralled. Not everyone
          shares his enthusiasm: Polonius, the pedantic politician, has become
          impatient.
        </p>
        <p>"This is too long."</p>
        <p>
          The nerve! Hamlet is exasperated. Too long? What are they supposed to
          do? Cut it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. But believe it or not, yes, a cut might be the best
          solution of all. To many directors, dramaturgs, and actors, cutting
          plays is an integral step in the process of theatre. Cuts might happen
          in deep pre-production, or at a table read, or in rehearsal, or even,
          quite rarely, in performance. Cuts happen to control the play’s
          length, to address modesty issues or cultural differences, or to fit a
          directorial concept. Cuts are common. Standard, even.
        </p>
        <p>
          To an outsider, cuts may seem audacious, hubristic, or even
          sacrilegious. You want to cut a play a playwright has authorized as
          complete? Who do you think you are? Such dismay has historical
          precedent. The famously opinionated George Bernard Shaw believed if
          you can’t perform Shakespeare uncut, then you shouldn’t perform it at
          all. The plays, Shaw suggested, were that length and had that content
          for a purpose. To change the content was to remove some of the play’s
          spirit: in his inimitable style, Shaw suggested adapters “[l]et
          Shakespear alone if you dont believe in him” (sic). Without a doubt,
          Shaw would be horrified to know how often his own works are cut to
          size today.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the purists, cuts may seem like unnecessary brutality inflicted on
          a beloved text, perpetrated out of fear of a classical play’s inherent
          intricacy. In fact, cutting is not only common, but also necessary.
          Polonius’s instinctive, "This is too long," does not necessarily
          betray a lack of sophistication, but perhaps an audience’s very real
          awareness they are no longer engaged. A company may faithfully retain
          every line in an original practices staging of Aeschylus’s The
          Persians (472 BCE), yet might potentially undermine their narrative if
          the audience’s attention wanders. Another company may insist their
          production of Aphra Behn’s The Rover (1677) is letter-perfect, and
          have the time and audience to embrace it. When these rare
          opportunities for uncut performance arrive, they can be instructive
          and fulfilling, albeit quite long.
        </p>
        <p>
          So: the question is, what do you cut? And how? And what happens to the
          rest of the play? Is it the same play? What about the purists? Is this
          sacreligious?
