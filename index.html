          <em>Cutting Plays for Performance</em> offers a practical guide for
          cutting a wide variety of classical and modern plays. This essential
          text offers insight into the various reasons for cutting, methods to
          serve different purposes (time, audience, story), and suggests ways of
          communicating cuts to a production team.

          This book is a step-by-step guide to how to cut a play. It covers
          structural issues, such as plot beats, rhetorical concepts, and legal
          considerations. This book revolves around the concept that no matter
          the era, the principles essential to formulating an impactful and
          effective script cut can be universally applied, based on character,
          narrative, structure, and concept. This practical guide offers useful
          case studies, interactive worksheets, and access to online tools to
          facilitate the text cutting process including calculating time and
          creating shareable cut scripts.

          No guide exists for directors or dramaturgs who need to cut play texts
          (even though everyone does it). This is that guide. At every level,
          from amateur and high school theatres to large-scale professional
          companies, directors and dramaturgs cut plays for time, content, and
          storytelling. Most learn by doing; no systematic guide exists, and it
          is a skill rarely taught in MFA programs. This text provides a
          resource for students and practitioners of directing and dramaturgy.
