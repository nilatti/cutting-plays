          <em>Cutting Plays for Performance</em> began as an argument between
          the authors over what, exactly, one might acceptably cut from
          <em>Richard III</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The argument happened to be at a planning meeting for the
          <a href="https://www.kcactf2.org/"
            >Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival, Region 2</a
          >. Our amused colleagues suggested that we should do a workshop at the
          festival on cutting Shakespeare's plays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop, in the winter of 2018, was a great deal of fun for all
          involved. At the end, one participant asked if we could recommend any
          books on cutting plays. We didn't know of any.
        </p>
        <p>
          After further research, we learned that no such book existed. Nearly
          everyone who directs public-domain plays cuts them in some fashion
          (for plays of certain periods, one might reasonably argue that no such
          thing as a "complete" text exists). No comprehensive guide to cutting
          existed, and nobody we spoke with had received any formal instruction
          in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          We began writing in the fall of 2020. A pandemic turned out to be the
          perfect time to write a book; not only were we not in rehearsal, but
          neither were the many people we hoped to use as resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          A true delight of the process was getting to interview many luminaries
          of the field, including James Shapiro, Tim Carroll, Martine Kei
          Greene-Rogers, Ralph Alan Cohen, Lue Douthit, and countless others. We
          hope you will enjoy their insights as much as we did.
